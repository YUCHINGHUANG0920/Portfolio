# Personal Portfolio Website
This is a personal portfolio website built with **React**.

It is based on the amazing [Saad Pasta's developerFolio template](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio), which I have customized to suit my own design and content preferences.

## Features
- Built with **React.js**
- Modular and easy to maintain
- Responsive design
- Animated transitions using `react-reveal`
- Custom sections/components added and styled
- Dynamic content configuration via a central `portfolio.js`
- Dark mode support
- Deployed with **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**

## Customizations I Made
- Modified the layout and structure of homepage sections
- Added new components and animations (e.g., fade/slide text effects)
- Updated content to reflect my background and projects
- Removed the original splash/loading screen
- Adjusted responsiveness and media queries
- Configured GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

## Deployment
This site is automatically deployed using **GitHub Pages** and **GitHub Actions**. Every push to the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the site to the `gh-pages` branch.
